# 🚀 The Printed Bay - Quick Setup Guide

## 📋 Project Overview

You now have a **fully functional Next.js-based 3D printing service** with comprehensive API routes! 

### ✅ What's Implemented:
- **File Upload API** - Handles STL/3D model uploads with validation
- **Model Analysis API** - Analyzes 3D models for pricing
- **Pricing Calculator** - Complex pricing with materials, quality, colors
- **Order Management** - Full order creation and tracking
- **Payment Processing** - Stripe integration for payments
- **3D Model Viewer** - Three.js integration for model preview

## 🤔 Do You Still Need Django?

**Likely NO** - Your Next.js API is comprehensive and handles:
- File processing, order management, payment processing, pricing calculations
- The only thing missing is persistent storage (currently uses in-memory storage)

**Consider keeping Django only if you need:**
- Complex database relationships and advanced ORM features  
- Django Admin interface for order management
- Advanced authentication systems

## 🔧 Local Development Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd front3nd
npm install
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables
Copy the export commands from `setup-local-env.sh` and replace the placeholder values:

```bash
# Copy these exports and replace with your real values:
export STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_your-actual-stripe-key"
export NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_your-actual-publishable-key"
export AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME="your-actual-azure-storage-name"
# ... etc (see setup-local-env.sh for full list)
```

### 3. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🔑 Required Environment Variables

### Critical for Basic Functionality:
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - For payment processing
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Frontend Stripe integration
- `AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME` - File storage
- `AZURE_ACCOUNT_KEY` - File storage access

### Optional but Recommended:
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY` - Email notifications
- `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` - Monitoring
- `SHIPPO_API_KEY` - Shipping integration

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Replace placeholder values** in your environment variables
2. **Test the upload flow** - try uploading an STL file
3. **Test pricing calculation** - select materials and get quotes
4. **Test order creation** - complete a full order flow
5. **Consider adding persistent storage** (database) if needed

## 💡 Architecture Decision

Your Next.js API is **production-ready** for a 3D printing service. The main consideration is whether you want to add a database for persistent storage or continue with the current approach (which works great for MVP and small-scale operations).

## 🔐 Security Notes

- All environment files are gitignored
- The setup script is gitignored to protect your secrets
- Never commit actual API keys or secrets to version control
- Use different keys for development vs production

**Happy printing! 🎨🖨️**
