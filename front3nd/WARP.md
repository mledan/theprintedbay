# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

Project: Next.js 14 app (TypeScript) for The Printed Bay - Professional 3D printing service frontend. Node 20.x+ required.

Commands
- Install deps: npm install
- Dev server: npm run dev
- Build: npm run build
- Start (after build): npm run start
- Lint: npm run lint
- Unit tests (Jest):
  - All: npm test
  - Watch: npm run test:watch
  - Coverage: npm run test:coverage
  - Single file: npx jest src/path/to/file.test.tsx
  - Filter by name: npx jest -t "test name substring"
- E2E tests (Playwright):
  - All: npm run test:e2e
  - Single spec: npx playwright test tests/e2e/path/to/spec.spec.ts
  - Specific project: npx playwright test tests/e2e/spec.spec.ts --project=chromium
  - Payment flow only: npm run test:e2e:payment
  - Launch UI runner: npm run test:e2e:ui

Environment and config
- Environment variables: Use .env.local for local development (see .env.local.example)
- Required for deployment:
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING: Azure Application Insights
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL: Backend API endpoint (defaults to /api)
- Optional services (see docs/GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md):
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY + STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: Payments
  - SENDGRID_API_KEY + SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL: Email notifications  
  - SHIPPO_API_KEY: Shipping labels
  - AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING: File storage
- Environment validation: Comprehensive checking with helpful error messages
- Service monitoring: Development dashboard shows which services are configured

Testing setup
- Unit tests: Jest configured via jest.config.js (next/jest). Key settings:
  - setupFilesAfterEnv: <rootDir>/jest.setup.js
  - testEnvironment: jest-environment-jsdom
  - Module alias: "@/*" â†’ src/*
  - Coverage collected from src/**/* with 70% global thresholds
  - Transforms ignore most node_modules except ESM allowances
- E2E tests: Playwright configured in playwright.config.ts
  - testDir: ./tests/e2e
  - fullyParallel: true; retries on CI; default reporter: html (output in playwright-report/)
  - use.baseURL: process.env.E2E_BASE_URL || http://localhost:3000
  - webServer: starts npm run dev with NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL set (defaults to http://127.0.0.1:8000/)
  - Projects: chromium, firefox; enable more by setting E2E_ALL_BROWSERS=1

Linting
- ESLint uses Next.js presets (next/core-web-vitals, next/typescript). Run: npm run lint
- Build-time linting is disabled (ignoreDuringBuilds: true) to avoid failing builds on warnings.

Build and deploy notes
- Next.js config (next.config.mjs):
  - output: 'export' for Azure Static Web Apps
  - trailingSlash: true, images: { unoptimized: true }
  - Build-time environment variable validation
  - Webpack optimizations for Three.js and vendor chunks
  - Performance optimizations: caching, SWC transforms
- Deployment: Azure Static Web Apps with GitHub Actions
- Required GitHub secrets (see docs/GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md):
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING
  - Optional: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL, service API keys
- Build performance: Enhanced with npm caching and Next.js build cache
